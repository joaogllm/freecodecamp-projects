          World Leaders Gather in Geneva for Historic Climate Summit
        </h2>
        <p class="article-text">
          Representatives from over 190 nations convened in Geneva yesterday for
          what many are calling the most consequential climate summit in a
          decade. Delegates arrived with ambitious targets after a year marked
          by record-breaking temperatures across five continents. The opening
          ceremony, attended by heads of state and environmental advocates
          alike, set a tone of cautious optimism — and urgent resolve. "We are
          not here to make promises," said the summit's chair. "We are here to
          make history." Negotiations are expected to continue through the
          weekend, with a landmark emissions agreement anticipated by Sunday
          evening.

          Urban Renewal Project Transforms the Old Harbor District
        </h2>
        <p class="article-text">
          What was once a stretch of derelict warehouses and crumbling piers has
          emerged as the city's most talked-about neighborhood. The Harbor
          District revitalization, five years in the making, officially opened
          its final phase this week with a ribbon-cutting attended by the mayor
          and hundreds of residents. The project has introduced 400 new
          affordable housing units, a waterfront promenade, three public parks,
          and a weekend market that already draws thousands of visitors. "This
          is what it looks like when a city bets on its own people," said lead
          architect Mara Okonkwo at the opening ceremony.
